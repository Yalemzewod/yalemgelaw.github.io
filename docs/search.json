    "text": "Abstract\nTo examine the use of symptoms, chest X-ray (CXR) abnormalities, and combinations of symptoms and CXR in excluding active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) before treating for latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) in high TB burden countries.\n\nWe updated a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the sensitivities, specificities, predictive values, diagnostic odds ratios and areas under the curve for index tests. The analysis was conducted using the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic method in R software.\n\nWe included 24 publications in the systematic review and meta-analysis. ‘Any CXR abnormality’ had the highest sensitivity (94.1%, 95%CI 85.8–97.7) among all index tests. ‘CXR abnormality suggestive of TB’ had a higher specificity (92.2%, 95%CI 89.7–94.1) than ‘any CXR abnormality’ (86.8%, 95%CI 79.7–91.7). The sensitivity for ‘any TB symptom’ was 73.0% (95%CI 64.1–80.4), while ‘prolonged cough’ of ???2 weeks had a specificity of 94.3% (95%CI 92.2–95.9). There was no significant difference in the sensitivity and specificity of all screening tools stratified by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) settings, with the exception of ‘CXR abnormality suggestive of TB’, which had a significantly higher sensitivity in low than in high HIV prevalence settings (effect estimate 2.26, 95%CI 0.69–3.82; P = 0.002).\n\nIn countries with a high TB burden, the absence of any TB symptom and any CXR abnormality can be used to exclude active pulmonary TB before initiating treatment for LTBI in household contacts aged ???5 years of patients with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB."

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\nBackground\nTo date, non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, are becoming severe public health challenges particularly in developing countries. Hypertension is a modifiable risk factor that contributes the leading role for mortality. The problem is significant in low- and middle-income countries like sub-Saharan Africa. However, there are limited studies in developing countries, particularly in Ethiopia. Hence, determining the magnitude of hypertension and identifying risk groups are important.\n\n\nMethods\nA community based cross sectional study was conducted in April 2013 among adults (age&gt;31 years) old. A systematic sampling technique was used to select a total of 518 study participants. Data were collected after full verbal informed consent was obtained from each participant. Multivariable logistic regressions were fitted to control the effect of confounding. Adjusted Odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to measure associations. Variables having P-value &lt;0.05 were considered as significant.\n\n\nResults\nThe overall prevalence of hypertension in Durame town was 22.4% (95% CI: 18.8–26.0). Nearly 40% of hypertensive patients were newly screened. Male sex [AOR  = 2.03, 95% CI; 1.05–3.93], age [AOR  = 29.49, 95% CI; 10.60–81.27], salt use [AOR  = 6.55, 95% CI; 2.31–18.53], eating vegetable three or fewer days per week [AOR  = 2.3,95% CI; 1.17–4.51], not continuously walking at least for 10 minutes per day [AOR  = 7.82, 95% CI; 2.37–25.82], having family history of hypertension [AOR  = 2.46, 95%CI; 1.31–4.61] and being overweight/obese [AOR  = 15.7, 95% CI 7.89–31.21)] were found to be risk factors for hypertension.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe prevalence of hypertension is found to be high. Older age, male sex, having family history of hypertension, physical inactivity, poor vegetable diet, additional salt consumption and obesity were important risk factors associated with hypertension among adults. Community level intervention measures with a particular emphasis on prevention by introducing lifestyle modifications are recommended."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nPertussis is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by Bordetella pertussis. It is one of the most common vaccine-preventable bacterial infections that affects all susceptible individuals, regardless of age. Investigation was done to verify the existence of an outbreak and to identify associated risk factors contributed for the occurrence of an outbreak in Tork and Warkaye villages of Mekdela district.\n\n\nMethods\nUnmatched community based case control and descriptive cross sectional investigation were conducted with one to two ratios. We used structured questionnaire to collect data from cases and controls.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 215 cases and eight deaths were identified with an overall attack rate of 1.3 per 1000 population. The mean age of the cases was 3.7 years which was ranged from 3 months to 45 years. The more affected groups were females. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, the risk factor that remained independently statically significant associated with developing pertussis was presence of infected person in the family AOR (adjusted odds ratio): 5.859, (95% CI 2.526–13.589). But previously sick with pertussis AOR: 0.053, (95% CI 0.006–0.460) and receiving full dose of vaccine AOR: 0.256, (95% CI 0.080–0.818) were remained as protective factors from pertussis infection.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe suspected pertussis outbreak was occurred in remote pocket villages/kebeles of Mekdela district. Routine immunization was not given regularly and functional refrigerators were not available in the health posts. Routine immunization services and treatment of infected patients with appropriate antibiotics should be intensified."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nUse of personal protective equipment is one of the important measures to safeguard workers from exposure to occupational hazards, especially in developing countries. However, there is a dearth of studies describing personal protective equipment utilization in Ethiopia. The present study has determined the magnitude of personal protective equipment utilization and identified associated factors among textile factory workers at Hawassa Town, southern Ethiopia.\n\n\nMethods\nAn institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among textile factory workers at Hawassa Town, southern Ethiopia from January to March 2014. Stratified sampling followed by simple random sampling techniques was used to select the total of 660 study participants. A pre-tested and structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Multivariate analyses were employed to see the effect of explanatory variables on dependent variable.\n\n\nResults\nThe magnitude of personal protective equipment utilization was 82.4 %. Service duration of &gt;10 years [AOR: 0.23, 95 % CI: (0.09, 0.58)], availability of personal protective equipments [AOR: 21.73, 95 % CI: (8.62, 54.79)], shift work [AOR: 2.28, 95 % CI: (1.12, 4.66)], alcohol drinking [AOR: 0.26, 95 % CI: (0.10, 0.66)], and cigarette smoking [AOR: 0.20, 95 % CI: (0.05, 0.78)] were factors significantly associated with use of personal protective equipment.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this study a relatively higher personal protective equipment utilization rate was reported compared to other studies in developing countries. However, this does not mean that there will be no need for further strengthening the safety programs as there are significant proportion of the workers still does not use all the necessary personal protective equipment during work. Interventions to promote use personal protective equipment should focus on areas, such as service duration, availability of protective equipment, presence of shift work, and control of substance abuse."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to far-reaching disruptions to health systems, including preventative and curative services for malaria. The aim of this study was to estimate the magnitude of disruptions in malaria case management in sub-Saharan Africa and their impact on malaria burden during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used survey data collected by the World Health Organization, in which individual country stakeholders reported on the extent of disruptions to malaria diagnosis and treatment. The relative disruption values were then applied to estimates of antimalarial treatment rates and used as inputs to an established spatiotemporal Bayesian geostatistical framework to generate annual malaria burden estimates with case management disruptions. This enabled an estimation of the additional malaria burden attributable to pandemic-related impacts on treatment rates in 2020 and 2021. Our analysis found that disruptions in access to antimalarial treatment in sub-Saharan Africa likely resulted in approximately 5.9 (4.4–7.2 95% CI) million more malaria cases and 76 (20–132) thousand additional deaths in the 2020–2021 period within the study region, equivalent to approximately 1.2% (0.3–2.1 95% CI) greater clinical incidence of malaria and 8.1% (2.1–14.1 95% CI) greater malaria mortality than expected in the absence of the disruptions to malaria case management. The available evidence suggests that access to antimalarials was disrupted to a significant degree and should be considered an area of focus to avoid further escalations in malaria morbidity and mortality. The results from this analysis were used to estimate cases and deaths in the World Malaria Report 2022 during the pandemic years."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nA key component of achieving universal health coverage is ensuring that all populations have access to quality health care. Examining where gains have occurred or progress has faltered across and within countries is crucial to guiding decisions and strategies for future improvement. We used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) to assess personal health-care access and quality with the Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index for 195 countries and territories, as well as subnational locations in seven countries, from 1990 to 2016.\n\n\nMethods\nDrawing from established methods and updated estimates from GBD 2016, we used 32 causes from which death should not occur in the presence of effective care to approximate personal health-care access and quality by location and over time. To better isolate potential effects of personal health-care access and quality from underlying risk factor patterns, we risk-standardised cause-specific deaths due to non-cancers by location-year, replacing the local joint exposure of environmental and behavioural risks with the global level of exposure. Supported by the expansion of cancer registry data in GBD 2016, we used mortality-to-incidence ratios for cancers instead of risk-standardised death rates to provide a stronger signal of the effects of personal health care and access on cancer survival. We transformed each cause to a scale of 0–100, with 0 as the first percentile (worst) observed between 1990 and 2016, and 100 as the 99th percentile (best); we set these thresholds at the country level, and then applied them to subnational locations. We applied a principal components analysis to construct the HAQ Index using all scaled cause values, providing an overall score of 0–100 of personal health-care access and quality by location over time. We then compared HAQ Index levels and trends by quintiles on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary measure of overall development. As derived from the broader GBD study and other data sources, we examined relationships between national HAQ Index scores and potential correlates of performance, such as total health spending per capita.\n\n\nFindings\nIn 2016, HAQ Index performance spanned from a high of 97·1 (95% UI 95·8–98·1) in Iceland, followed by 96·6 (94·9–97·9) in Norway and 96·1 (94·5–97·3) in the Netherlands, to values as low as 18·6 (13·1–24·4) in the Central African Republic, 19·0 (14·3–23·7) in Somalia, and 23·4 (20·2–26·8) in Guinea-Bissau. The pace of progress achieved between 1990 and 2016 varied, with markedly faster improvements occurring between 2000 and 2016 for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, whereas several countries in Latin America and elsewhere saw progress stagnate after experiencing considerable advances in the HAQ Index between 1990 and 2000. Striking subnational disparities emerged in personal health-care access and quality, with China and India having particularly large gaps between locations with the highest and lowest scores in 2016. In China, performance ranged from 91·5 (89·1–93·6) in Beijing to 48·0 (43·4–53·2) in Tibet (a 43·5-point difference), while India saw a 30·8-point disparity, from 64·8 (59·6–68·8) in Goa to 34·0 (30·3–38·1) in Assam. Japan recorded the smallest range in subnational HAQ performance in 2016 (a 4·8-point difference), whereas differences between subnational locations with the highest and lowest HAQ Index values were more than two times as high for the USA and three times as high for England. State-level gaps in the HAQ Index in Mexico somewhat narrowed from 1990 to 2016 (from a 20·9-point to 17·0-point difference), whereas in Brazil, disparities slightly increased across states during this time (a 17·2-point to 20·4-point difference). Performance on the HAQ Index showed strong linkages to overall development, with high and high-middle SDI countries generally having higher scores and faster gains for non-communicable diseases. Nonetheless, countries across the development spectrum saw substantial gains in some key health service areas from 2000 to 2016, most notably vaccine-preventable diseases. Overall, national performance on the HAQ Index was positively associated with higher levels of total health spending per capita, as well as health systems inputs, but these relationships were quite heterogeneous, particularly among low-to-middle SDI countries.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGBD 2016 provides a more detailed understanding of past success and current challenges in improving personal health-care access and quality worldwide. Despite substantial gains since 2000, many low-SDI and middle-SDI countries face considerable challenges unless heightened policy action and investments focus on advancing access to and quality of health care across key health services, especially non-communicable diseases. Stagnating or minimal improvements experienced by several low-middle to high-middle SDI countries could reflect the complexities of re-orienting both primary and secondary health-care services beyond the more limited foci of the Millennium Development Goals. Alongside initiatives to strengthen public health programmes, the pursuit of universal health coverage hinges upon improving both access and quality worldwide, and thus requires adopting a more comprehensive view—and subsequent provision—of quality health care for all populations."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nIntroduction\nThe diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF is well documented but underutilization is a major challenge in most high burden countries. This appears to be linked with insufficient knowledge of health professionals of using the tool. However, this has not been well studied.\n\n\nObjective\nOur objective was to assess the knowledge of health professionals on Xpert MTB/RIF assay and associated factors in detecting TB/TB drug resistance.\n\n\nMethods\nAn institution based cross–sectional study was conducted from April 4 to June 5, 2015, in Addis Ababa that involved 209 healthcare providers working in TB clinics. Structured questionnaire through self-administered interview technique was used to collect the data. We asked them about Xpert on whether they are aware of its place in TB diagnosis, when and for whom it shall be used, its role in treatment monitoring, result interpretation and patient’s registration that are diagnosed by Xpert MTB/RIF. We used binary logistic regression analysis to identify associated factors. Odds ratio with 95% CI was computed to assess the strength of the associations.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 209 participants interviewed, the majority 151 (72.2%) were nurses. More than a half of the respondents 114 (54.6%) had poor knowledge. Health professionals with age above 35 years (AOR = 6.253, 95% CI (1.1995, 19.604)) and those who read the Xpert guideline (AOR = 4.231, 95% CI (2.011, 8.900)) were more likely to have good knowledge on Xpert.\n\n\nConclusion and recommendation\nThis study revealed that the overall magnitude of knowledge status was found to be low. Health workers above 35 years and those who read the guideline on Xpert had higher knowledge status on Xpert. Distribution of national guideline on Xpert and assigning experienced clinicians in TB DOTs clinics are recommended."

Though manifold factors have reported as determinant factors of antiretroviral therapy adherence status, perhaps determinants of non-adherence differ up on the activities of patients in the study setting.\n\n\nMethods\nAn institution based unmatched case–control study was conducted in Aksum town. Individuals who had a 6-month follow-up with complete individual information were included in the study. Document review and interviewer based techniques were used to collect the data. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the determinant factors of non-adherence.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 411 (137 cases and 274 control) study participants were included in the study. The majority of them were male in sex.

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground COVID-19 has caused a global public health crisis affecting most countries, including Ethiopia, in various ways. This study maps the vulnerability to infection, case severity and likelihood of death from COVID-19 in Ethiopia.\nMethods Thirty-eight potential indicators of vulnerability to COVID-19 infection, case severity and likelihood of death, identified based on a literature review and the availability of nationally representative data at a low geographic scale, were assembled from multiple sources for geospatial analysis. Geospatial analysis techniques were applied to produce maps showing the vulnerability to infection, case severity and likelihood of death in Ethiopia at a spatial resolution of 1 km×1 km.\nResults This study showed that vulnerability to COVID-19 infection is likely to be high across most parts of Ethiopia, particularly in the Somali, Afar, Amhara, Oromia and Tigray regions. The number of severe cases of COVID-19 infection requiring hospitalisation and intensive care unit admission is likely to be high across Amhara, most parts of Oromia and some parts of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples’ Region. The risk of COVID-19-related death is high in the country’s border regions, where public health preparedness for responding to COVID-19 is limited.\nConclusion This study revealed geographical differences in vulnerability to infection, case severity and likelihood of death from COVID-19 in Ethiopia. The study offers maps that can guide the targeted interventions necessary to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Ethiopia."

We included all relevant literature published up until 11 August 2020.\nData extraction and synthesis We performed a systematic narrative synthesis to describe the available studies for each outcome. Data were extracted using a standardised Joanna Briggs Institute data extraction form.\nResults Fifteen articles met the inclusion criteria of which four were exclusively on Africa and the remaining 11 papers had a global focus with some data from Africa. Higher rates of infection in Africa are associated with high population density, urbanisation, transport connectivity, high volume of tourism and international trade, and high level of economic and political openness. Limited or poor access to healthcare are also associated with higher COVID-19 infection rates. Older people and individuals with chronic conditions such as HIV, tuberculosis and anaemia experience severe forms COVID-19 leading to hospitalisation and death. Similarly, high burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, high prevalence of tobacco consumption and low levels of expenditure on health and low levels of global health security score contribute to COVID-19 related deaths.\nConclusions Demographic, institutional, ecological, health system and politico-economic factors influenced the spectrum of COVID-19 infection, severity and death. We recommend multidisciplinary and integrated approaches to mitigate the identified factors and strengthen effective prevention strategies."

This study aimed to estimate the incidence and predictors of death among MDR-TB patients in central Ethiopia. A retrospective follow-up study was conducted at three hospitals in the Amhara region on 451 patients receiving treatment for MDR-TB from September 2010 to January 2017. Data were collected from patient registration books, charts and computer databases. Data were fitted to a parametric frailty model and survival was expressed as an adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The median follow-up time of participants was 20 months (interquartile range: 12, 22) and 46 (10.20%) of patients died during this period. The incidence rate of mortality was 7.42 (95% CI 5.56–9.91)/100 person-years. Older age (AHR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.01–1.08), inability to self-care (AHR = 13.71, 95% CI 5.46–34.40), co-morbidity (AHR = 5.74, 95% CI 2.19–15.08), low body mass index (AHR = 4.13, 95% CI 1.02–16.64), acute lung complications (AHR = 4.22, 95% CI 1.66–10.70) and lung consolidation at baseline (AHR = 5.27, 95% CI 1.06–26.18) were independent predictors of mortality. Most of the identified predictor factors of death in this study were considered to be avoidable if the TB programme had provided nutritional support for malnourished patients and ensured a close follow-up of the elderly, and patients with co-morbidities."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nAmhara Region has the largest at-risk population in Ethiopia, with widespread traditional practices that are likely to increase transmission of HIV. However, the identification and characterization of HIV hotspots within this region have not been undertaken. This study aimed to explore and describe the geographical pattern of HIV infection using notification data in Amhara Region, Ethiopia.\n\n\nMethods\nData on HIV infection at the district level were obtained from the Amhara Regional Health Bureau. A Bayesian conditional autoregressive (CAR) model was used to explore the association between HIV infection and socio-demographic variables in OpenBUGS.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 35 210 new HIV cases were reported during 2015–2017 in Amhara Region, Ethiopia. Metema and Mirab Armacho districts were found to be hotspots throughout the study period. There was a decrease in HIV infection in 2016 (odds ratio 0.77, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.72–0.82) and 2017 (odds ratio 0.71, 95% CrI 0.60–0.76) as compared with HIV infection in 2015. HIV infection increased by 1.004 (95% CrI 1.001–1.008) and 1.47 (95% CrI 1.11–3.59) for a one-unit increase in the proportion of the population who had never attended school and migrants, respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study identified spatial clustering of HIV infection in Amhara Region, with a slight reduction in the annual infection rates from 2015 to 2017. The proportion of the population who were migrants or who had a low educational status was associated with a high risk of infection. Access to HIV counselling and the promotion of condom utilization, integrated with other health care services, targeting those with a lower level of education and seasonal migrants, are important strategies for the prevention of new HIV infections."

Individuals with HIV enrolled from six randomly selected health facilities were included in the study. Cases were people living with HIV who had cluster of differentiation four count &lt;350 cells/μl or World Health Organization stages 3 or 4. A total of 442 study participants were included by systematic sampling techniques. Bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regression model was used to identify associated factors. Odds ratio with 95 % CI was computed to assess the strength of the associations.\n\n\nResult\nAge categories, 25–29 years [AOR 3, 95 % CI (1.2–8.1)] and 35–39 years [AOR 4.1, 95 % CI (1.4–12.5)], having two [AOR 6, 95 % CI (1.3–28)] and more [AOR 5.2, 95 % CI (1.1–24.8)] lifetime sexual partners, poor social support [AOR 2.3, 95 % CI (1.26–4.30)], second (next to lowest) wealth quintile [AOR 3.3, 95 % CI 91.3–8.5)], fear of stigma [AOR 4.4, 95 % CI (2.2–8.3)], fear of losing job [AOR 6.8, 95 % CI (1.8–24.5)], and reported severe illness [AOR 4.3, 95 % CI (2.26–8)] were identified to be the risk factors for late presentation.\n\n\nConclusion\nLow socio-economic status and social support, fear of stigma were potential risk factors for late presentation. Efforts towards promoting early care seeking should target on these factors in the study area and other similar settings."

    "text": "Abstract\nObjectives This study aimed to map the national, regional and local prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in Ethiopia.\nDesign and setting Nationwide cross-sectional survey in Ethiopia combined with georeferenced ecological level data from publicly available sources.\nParticipants 9801 participants aged between 15 and 69 years.\nPrimary outcome measures Prevalence of hypertension and diabetes were collected using the WHO’s STEPS survey approach. Bayesian model-based geostatistical techniques were used to estimate hypertension and diabetes prevalence at national, regional and pixel levels (1×1 km2) with corresponding 95% credible intervals (95% CrIs).\nResults The national prevalence was 19.2% (95% CI: 18.4 to 20.0) for hypertension and 2.8% (95% CI: 2.4 to 3.1) for diabetes. Substantial variation was observed in the prevalence of these diseases at subnational levels, with the highest prevalence of hypertension observed in Addis Ababa (30.6%) and diabetes in Somali region (8.7%). Spatial overlap of high hypertension and diabetes prevalence was observed in some regions such as the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People’s region and Addis Ababa. Population density (number of people/km2) was positively associated with the prevalence of hypertension (β: 0.015; 95% CrI: 0.003–0.027) and diabetes (β: 0.046; 95% CrI: 0.020–0.069); whereas altitude in kilometres was negatively associated with the prevalence of diabetes (β: –0.374; 95% CrI: –0.711 to –0.044).\nConclusions Spatial clustering of hypertension and diabetes was observed at subnational and local levels in Ethiopia, which was significantly associated with population density and altitude. The variation at the subnational level illustrates the need to include environmental drivers in future NCDs burden estimation. Thus, targeted and integrated interventions in high-risk areas might reduce the burden of hypertension and diabetes in Ethiopia."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nExclusive breastfeeding is defined as feeding an infant breast milk only, for the first six months. In Ethiopia, more than half of infants do not receive exclusive breastfeeding. Workplace barriers contribute to these low rates of exclusive breastfeeding practices. Understanding the sociodemographic, health related, behavioral and economic factors is crucial to promote the practice of exclusive breastfeeding in Ethiopia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the extent of exclusive breastfeeding practice and associated factors among employed and unemployed mothers with children of age 7–12 months in Gondar town, northwest Ethiopia, 2015.\n\n\nMethods\nA community based comparative cross-sectional study was conducted in October 2015. Simple random sampling technique was used to select 649 eligible mothers with children age 7–12 months during the study period. A structured and pretested interviewer administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. Three logistic regression models: whole sample, employed and not employed, were fitted.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 649 (333 unemployed and 316 employed) mothers were interviewed. The mean duration of mothers to exclusively breastfeed was 4.77 months (± 1.36 Standard Deviation [SD]). Exclusive breastfeeding was higher among unemployed 48.0% with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) (42.0%, 54.0%) than employed (20.9%) with 95% CI (16.0%, 25.0%). Parity of three children and above (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 3.48), and having social support (AOR = 3.45) were positively associated with exclusive breastfeeding while poor knowledge (AOR = 0.30), wealth index of the medium level (AOR = 0.38) were negatively associated among employed mothers. In the case of unemployed mothers, vaginal delivery (AOR = 2.60) and having social support (AOR = 3.03) were positively associated with exclusive breastfeeding while, poor knowledge (AOR = 0.28), and not having antenatal care (AOR = 0.56) were negatively associated.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe overall exclusive breastfeeding practice of mothers was low. However, unemployed mothers breastfeed more than employed mothers. Providing a special support for employed mothers and revising either the legislation of the two month postpartum maternity leave or applying different alternatives is recommended."

Therefore, this study assessed the prevalence of long acting and permanent family planning method utilization and associated factors among women in reproductive age groups who have decided not to have more children in Gondar city, northwest Ethiopia.\n\n\nMethod\nAn institution based cross-sectional study was conducted from August to October, 2015. Three hundred seventeen women who have decided not to have more children were selected consecutively into the study. A structured and pretested questionnaire was used to collect data. Both bivariate and multi-variable logistic regressions analyses were used to identify factors associated with utilization of long acting and permanent family planning methods. The multi-variable logistic regression analysis was used to investigate factors associated with the utilization of long acting and permanent family planning methods. The Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with the corresponding 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was used to show the strength of associations, and variables with a P-value of &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\n\nResults\nIn this study, the overall prevalence of long acting and permanent contraceptive (LAPCM) method utilization was 34.7% (95% CI: 29.5-39.9). According to the multi-variable logistic regression analysis, utilization of long acting and permanent contraceptive methods was significantly associated with women who had secondary school, (AOR: 2279, 95% CI: 1.17, 4.44), college, and above education (AOR: 2.91, 95% CI: 1.36, 6.24), history of previous utilization (AOR: 3.02, 95% CI: 1.69, 5.38), and information about LAPCM (AOR: 8.85, 95% CI: 2.04, 38.41).\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this study the prevalence of long acting and permanent family planning method utilization among women who have decided not to have more children was high compared with previous studies conducted elsewhere. Advanced educational status, previous utilization of LAPCM, and information on LAPCM were significantly associated with the utilization of LAPCM. As a result, strengthening behavioral change communication channels to make information accessible is highly recommended."

Different studies revealed that eating disorders is a pressing public health problem among adolescents. Eating disorders may also lead to mortality due to their physiological sequelae. There is no previous study regarding disordered of eating attitude in Ethiopian adolescents. Therefore, this study aimed to assess prevalence of disordered eating attitude and its associated factors among adolescents in Addis Ababa high schools.\n\n\nMethods\nA school-based cross sectional study was conducted. Data were collected among 836 high school adolescents aged 12–19 years from May to June, 2015 in Addis Ababa city. The data were collected by self-administered questionnaire containing eating attitudes test-26 items (EAT-26) and socio-demographic factors. Binary logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify factors associated with disordered eating attitude. Both crude odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio were calculated to show the strength of association. In multivariable analysis, variables with a P value of &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalence of disordered eating attitude among adolescents was 8.6% [95% CI 4.9, 12.3].

There is still, 2.5 million children die by vaccine preventable disease every year in developing countries. In Ethiopia, default to fully completion of child immunization is high and determinants of default to completions are not explored well in the study setting. The aim of the study was to identify determinants of default to fully completion of immunization among children between ages 12 to 23 months in Sodo Zurea District, Southern Ethiopia. Methods: Community based unmatched case-control study was conducted. Census was done to identify cases and controls before the actual data collection. A total of 344 samples (172 cases and 172 controls) were selected by simple random sampling technique. Cases were children in the age group of 12 to 23 months old who missed at least one dose from the recommended schedule. Bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regression was used to identify the determinant factors. Odds ratio, 95%CI and p - value less than 0.05 was used to measure the presence and strength of the association. Results: Mothers of infants who are unable to read and write (AOR=8.9; 95%CI: 2.4, 33.9) and attended primary school (AOR=4.1; 95% CI:1.4-15.8), mothers who had no postnatal care follow up (AOR=0.4; 95%CI: 0.3, 0.7), good maternal knowledge towards immunization (AOR= 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3, 0.8) and maternal favorable perception towards uses of health institution for maternal and child care (AOR= 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1, 0.6) were significant determinant factors to default to fully completion of immunization. Conclusion: Working on maternal education, postnatal care follow up, promoting maternal knowledge and perception about child immunization are recommended measures to mitigate defaults to complete immunization."

A woman’s decision-making power, be it individual or decision made in collaboration with a partner, is the most important factor in the use of family planning in a household. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of women’s decision making power on family planning use and its associated factors.\n\n\nMethods\nA community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on married women in the child bearing age. The women who were living in Mizan city were selected using the simple random sampling method. Trained nurses collected the data by interview, using a structured and pre-tested questioner. Bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the associated factors, and the odds ratio with a 95 % CI was computed to assess the strength of the association. Collinearity was also assessed by looking at standard errors in the final fitted model.\n\n\nResult\nOverall, more than two-thirds [67.2 %: 95 % CI (63–71 %)] of the married women were found to be more autonomous to decide family planning use. Secondary education [AOR: 9.04, 95 % CI: (4.50, 18.16)], government employment [AOR: 4.84, 95 % CI: (2.03, 11.52)], being wives of government employed spouses [AOR 2.71, 95 % CI: (1.24, 7.97)], having husbands with college or university education [AOR: 11.29, 95 % CI: (4.66, 27.35)], and being in the younger age [AOR: 0.27, 95 % CI :(0.09, 0.75)] were significantly associated with women’s decision-making power on family planning.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this study, women had a high decision making power in family planning use. Age category (34–44-years), formal education, and occupational status had effects on women’s decision making power. Promoting parental adult education and engaging women in out of house employment is essential to improve their decision making power in using family planning."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nDiabetes mellitus is becoming a big public health challenge, particularly in developing countries like Ethiopia. It is a manageable disease if early screening and follow up is made. However, as studies in Ethiopia are limited and unorganized, determining the magnitude of prediabetes and diabetes and identifying associated risk factors is quite essential.\n\n\nMethods\nA community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted from February to April 2015 among adults (aged ≥20 years) in a rural Koladiba town. A multistage sampling technique was used to select a total of 392 study participants. Data were collected after a fully informed written consent was obtained from each participant. Demographic, behavioral, and clinical data were collected using a well-structured questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to control the effect of confounders. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were computed to measure associations. A p value of &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalence of impaired fasting glucose and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus were 12% (95% CI 9–16) and 2.3% (95% CI 1.1–4), respectively, in Koladiba. Overweight (AOR: 4.257, 95% CI 1.345–13.476), obesity (AOR: 5.26, 95% CI 1.138–24.316), hypertriglyceridemia (AOR: 2.83, 95% CI 1.451–5.521), and systolic hypertension (AOR: 3.858, 95% CI 1.62–9.189) were found to be independently associated with impaired fasting glucose. Positive family history of diabetes also showed a marginal association with impaired fasting glucose (p = 0.057). Male sex (p = 0.012) and hypertriglyceridemia (p = 0.030) were associated with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe prevalence of impaired fasting glucose and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus are found to be significant. Obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, and systolic hypertension are independently associated with impaired fasting glucose among adults. We recommend that the community be aware of healthy life style, early screening, and maintain continuous follow up."

Therefore, this study aimed to assess willingness to pay for community-based health insurance and associated factors among rural households of Bugna District, Ethiopia.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 532 study participants were included in the study. The finding indicated that 77.8% of the households were willing to pay for the community-based health insurance. The average amount of money the households were willing to pay per household per annum was 233 ETB ($11.12 USD). The result of the study also revealed that attending formal education[????=???3.20; 95% CI???=???1.87, 4.53], history of illness [????=???2.52; 95% CI???=???1.29, 3.75], household size [????=???0.408; 95% CI???=???0.092, 0.724], awareness about the scheme [????=???2.96; 95% CI???=???1.61, 4.30], and wealth status [????=???5.55; 95% CI???=???4.19, 6.90] were factors significantly associated with willingness to pay. Therefore, enhancing awareness of the community about the scheme, considering the amount of premium as per household family size and wealth status might increase household’s willingness to pay for community-based health insurance."

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: Restoration of Aboriginal children (also called reunification) is an under-researched area despite being the preferred permanency outcome for children.\nObjective: To investigate the rate of restoration for Aboriginal children, the factors that influence restoration, and to explore the experiences of parents whose Aboriginal children have been restored, and their children. Participants and setting Analyses were conducted using data from the NSW Department of Communities and Justice Pathways of Care Longitudinal Study (POCLS). Methods: The quantitative sample includes all Aboriginal children in NSW who were on final Children’s Court care and protection orders by 30 April 2013. Qualitative data were extracted from the POCLS survey instruments.\nResults: Of the 1018 Aboriginal children in the study, 15.2% were restored. Around 40 % of children entered care following just one (or no) substantiated Risk of Significant Harm reports. Children entering care under the age of 2 years were the least likely to be restored. Parents expressed dissatisfaction with child protection agencies and family support services both at the time their child was removed and in the restoration period. Parents and children expressed the importance of being supported to maintain family relationships while children are in care.\nConclusions: Despite policy priorities to the contrary, few Aboriginal children are considered for restoration. More support is needed for Aboriginal parents interfacing with all stages of the care system and following restoration. Additional research is needed to understand the factors underlying decisions to remove Aboriginal children from their families and whether restoration to their family is considered or achieved."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nPopulation estimates underpin demographic and epidemiological research and are used to track progress on numerous international indicators of health and development. To date, internationally available estimates of population and fertility, although useful, have not been produced with transparent and replicable methods and do not use standardised estimates of mortality. We present single-calendar year and single-year of age estimates of fertility and population by sex with standardised and replicable methods.\n\n\nMethods\nWe estimated population in 195 locations by single year of age and single calendar year from 1950 to 2017 with standardised and replicable methods. We based the estimates on the demographic balancing equation, with inputs of fertility, mortality, population, and migration data. Fertility data came from 7817 location-years of vital registration data, 429 surveys reporting complete birth histories, and 977 surveys and censuses reporting summary birth histories. We estimated age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs; the annual number of livebirths to women of a specified age group per 1000 women in that age group) by use of spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression and used the ASFRs to estimate total fertility rates (TFRs; the average number of children a woman would bear if she survived through the end of the reproductive age span [age 10–54 years] and experienced at each age a particular set of ASFRs observed in the year of interest). Because of sparse data, fertility at ages 10–14 years and 50–54 years was estimated from data on fertility in women aged 15–19 years and 45–49 years, through use of linear regression. Age-specific mortality data came from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 estimates. Data on population came from 1257 censuses and 761 population registry location-years and were adjusted for underenumeration and age misreporting with standard demographic methods. Migration was estimated with the GBD Bayesian demographic balancing model, after incorporating information about refugee migration into the model prior. Final population estimates used the cohort-component method of population projection, with inputs of fertility, mortality, and migration data. Population uncertainty was estimated by use of out-of-sample predictive validity testing. With these data, we estimated the trends in population by age and sex and in fertility by age between 1950 and 2017 in 195 countries and territories.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom 1950 to 2017, TFRs decreased by 49·4% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 46·4–52·0). The TFR decreased from 4·7 livebirths (4·5–4·9) to 2·4 livebirths (2·2–2·5), and the ASFR of mothers aged 10–19 years decreased from 37 livebirths (34–40) to 22 livebirths (19–24) per 1000 women. Despite reductions in the TFR, the global population has been increasing by an average of 83·8 million people per year since 1985. The global population increased by 197·2% (193·3–200·8) since 1950, from 2·6 billion (2·5–2·6) to 7·6 billion (7·4–7·9) people in 2017; much of this increase was in the proportion of the global population in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The global annual rate of population growth increased between 1950 and 1964, when it peaked at 2·0%; this rate then remained nearly constant until 1970 and then decreased to 1·1% in 2017. Population growth rates in the southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania GBD super-region decreased from 2·5% in 1963 to 0·7% in 2017, whereas in sub-Saharan Africa, population growth rates were almost at the highest reported levels ever in 2017, when they were at 2·7%. The global average age increased from 26·6 years in 1950 to 32·1 years in 2017, and the proportion of the population that is of working age (age 15–64 years) increased from 59·9% to 65·3%. At the national level, the TFR decreased in all countries and territories between 1950 and 2017; in 2017, TFRs ranged from a low of 1·0 livebirths (95% UI 0·9–1·2) in Cyprus to a high of 7·1 livebirths (6·8–7·4) in Niger. The TFR under age 25 years (TFU25; number of livebirths expected by age 25 years for a hypothetical woman who survived the age group and was exposed to current ASFRs) in 2017 ranged from 0·08 livebirths (0·07–0·09) in South Korea to 2·4 livebirths (2·2–2·6) in Niger, and the TFR over age 30 years (TFO30; number of livebirths expected for a hypothetical woman ageing from 30 to 54 years who survived the age group and was exposed to current ASFRs) ranged from a low of 0·3 livebirths (0·3–0·4) in Puerto Rico to a high of 3·1 livebirths (3·0–3·2) in Niger. TFO30 was higher than TFU25 in 145 countries and territories in 2017. 33 countries had a negative population growth rate from 2010 to 2017, most of which were located in central, eastern, and western Europe, whereas population growth rates of more than 2·0% were seen in 33 of 46 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2017, less than 65% of the national population was of working age in 12 of 34 high-income countries, and less than 50% of the national population was of working age in Mali, Chad, and Niger.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPopulation trends create demographic dividends and headwinds (ie, economic benefits and detriments) that affect national economies and determine national planning needs. Although TFRs are decreasing, the global population continues to grow as mortality declines, with diverse patterns at the national level and across age groups. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide transparent and replicable estimates of population and fertility, which can be used to inform decision making and to monitor progress."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nAge at natural menopause (ANM) is considered as a biologic marker of health and ageing. The relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) and ANM is currently unknown, and whether smoking plays a role in this relationship is unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the association between IPV and ANM and to quantify the effect mediated through smoking.\n\n\nMethods\nData were drawn from the 1946–51 cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health, a prospective cohort study first conducted in 1996. History of IPV (yes or no) was self-reported at baseline. ANM was confirmed by at least 12 months of cessation of menses where this was not a result of medical interventions such as bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy and categorised as &lt;45 (early menopause), 45–49, 50–51, 52–53, and ≥54 years. Regression models and mediation analyses based on the counterfactual framework were performed to examine the relationship between IPV and ANM and to quantify the proportion mediated through smoking (never, past, current &lt;10, 10–19 and ≥20 cigarettes/day).\n\n\nResults\nOf 6138 women in the study with natural menopause, 932 (15%) reported a history of IPV and 429 (7.0%) had an early ANM (before age 45 years). Women with IPV were more likely to smoke and be heavy smokers (Odds Ratio: 2.77, 95% CI 2.19–3.51). Women with IPV were also at increased risk of early menopause (ANM &lt;45 years) (Relative Risk Ratio: 1.36, 95% CI 1.03–1.80) after accounting for education level, income difficulties, age at menarche, parity, body mass index, and perceived stress, compared to the reference group (women without IPV and ANM at 50–51 years). This relationship was attenuated after adjusting for smoking (Relative Risk Ratio: 1.20, 95% CI 0.90–1.59). Mediation analysis showed that cigarette smoking explained 36.7% of the association between IPV and early menopause (ANM &lt;45 vs. ≥45 years).\n\n\nConclusion\nCigarette smoking substantially mediated the relationship between IPV and early menopause. Findings suggest that as part of addressing the impact of IPV, timely interventions that result in cessation of smoking will partly mitigate the increased risk of early menopause."

This study assessed the health care seeking behavior and associated factors of urban and rural mothers for common childhood illness in Northwest Ethiopia.\n\n\nMethods\nA comparative community based cross-sectional study was conducted among urban and rural mothers living in the district. A multistage sampling technique was used to select the study participants. A pre-tested and structured questioner via interview was used to collect the data. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify associated factors. Odds ratio with 95% CI was computed to assess the strength of the associations.\n\n\nResult\nA total of 827 (274 urban and 553 rural) mothers were interviewed. Among these, 79.3% (95% CI: (76.5%, 82.06%)) of the mothers were sought health care in the district. Health care seeking behavior was higher among urban mothers (84.6%) than rural mothers (76.7%). Marital status, completion health extension package, and sex of child were significantly associated with health care seeking behavior of urban mothers. Whereas age of child, age and occupation of mothers, educational level of fathers, wealth quintile, and type of reported illness were significantly associated with rural mothers. Perceived severity of illness was significantly associated with both urban and rural mothers for health care seeking behavior.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe overall health seeking behaviors of mothers for common childhood illness was high. However, urban mothers seek health care more than rural. Socio Economic position and types of reported illness has an effect for health seeking behavior of rural mothers. Whereas child sex preference and graduation status for health extension package has an effect for health care seeking behavior of urban mothers. Work on strengthen accessibility of health care services in the rural mothers and increase awareness of mothers about the disadvantage of sex preferences will improve the health care seek behavior of families regardless of the severity of illness and types of illnesses."

The Amhara Region is one of the main TB hotspot regions in the country. In this study we identified the spatial distribution of TB and characterized the sociodemographic factors of spatial clusters in the Amhara Region.\nMethods\nAn ecological spatial analysis of TB notifications from 2014 to 2017 was conducted to quantify the presence and location of spatial clusters of TB notifications at the district level within the Amhara Region. Global Moran’s I statistics and local indicators of spatial association were used to explore the spatial clustering of TB notifications. Notifications from hotspots and low-risk districts were compared to identify significant sociodemographic factors using analysis of variance and Classification and Regression Tree analysis. The geographic information system and ‘sp’ packages of R software were used for spatial analysis.\nResults\nFrom 2014 to 2017 the average notification rate of all forms of TB in the Amhara Region was 107/100 000 population (range 18–614 per 100 000 population). District-level TB notification rates were positively spatially autocorrelated, with Moran’s I value ranging from 0.207 to 0.276 (p=0.01). Hotspot TB clusters were found in the northwest and central part of the region. The proportion of migrants (F(3,124)=23.21, p&lt;0.001, d=1.4) was found to be the most important factor associated with hotspot TB clustering.\nConclusions\nTB notification rates in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia over the past 4 y were significantly clustered. Distinguishing high-risk areas from low-risk areas and characterizing the proportion of migrants and other risk factors is important for targeted TB prevention and control in the region."

    "text": "Abstract\nHIV associated tuberculosis (TB) morbidity and mortality is a major concern in sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding the level of HIV infection among TB patients is vital for adequate response. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of HIV in TB patients in sub-Saharan Africa. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CINAHL databases. A meta-analysis with a random-effects model was performed. Potential sources of heterogeneity in the prevalence estimates were explored using meta-regression analysis. We identified 68 studies that collectively included 62,969?TB patients between 1990 and 2017. The overall estimate of HIV prevalence in TB patients was 31.8% (95% CI 27.8–36.1). There was substantial heterogeneity in the prevalence estimates in Southern, Central, Eastern, and Western sub-Saharan Africa regions (43.7, 41.3, 31.1 and 25.5%, respectively). We noted an apparent reduction in the estimate from 33.7% (95% CI 27.6–40.4) in the period before 2000 to 25.7% (95% CI 17.6–336.6) in the period after 2010. The Eastern and Southern sub-Saharan Africa region had higher prevalence [34.4% (95% CI 29.3–34.4)] than the Western and Central region [27.3% (95% CI 21.6–33.8)]. The prevalence of HIV in TB patients has declined over time in sub-Saharan Africa. We argue that this is due to strengthened HIV prevention and control response and enhanced TB/HIV collaborative activities. Countries and regions with high burdens of HIV and TB should strengthen and sustain efforts in order to achieve the goal of ending both HIV and TB epidemics in line with the Sustainable Development Goals."

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: Integrating and scaling up tuberculosis (TB) and HIV services are essential strategies to achieve the combined goals ending both TB and HIV, especially in TB and HIV high burden countries. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of TB and HIV co-infection and the implementation of collaborative services in Ethiopia.\nMethods: We used a national sentinel surveillance TB/HIV co-infection collected between 2010 and 2015. The Ethiopian Public Health Institute collected and collated the data quarterly from 79 health facilities in nine regional states and two city administrations.\nResults: A total of 55,336 people living with HIV/AIDS were screened for active TB between 2011 and 2015. Of these, 7.3% were found co-infected with TB, and 13% TB-negative PLWHA were on isoniazid preventive therapy. Nine out of ten (89.2%) active TB patients were screened for HIV counselling and 17.8% were found to be HIV positive; 78.2% and 53.0% of HIV/TB co-infected patients were receiving cotrimoxazole preventive therapy and antiretroviral treatment, respectively.\nConclusion: This study showed that the prevalence of TB and HIV co-infection failed to decrease over the study period, and that, while there was an increasing trend for integration of collaborative services, this was not uniform over time. Aligning and integrating TB and HIV responses are still needed to achieve the target of ending TB and HIV by 2030."

Exploring the spatial pattern of childhood diarrhea is important to monitor and design effective intervention programs. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the spatial patterns of childhood diarrhea in Ethiopia over the past one decade.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 29,358 under-five children were retrieved from three consecutive Ethiopian demographic and health surveys (2000, 2005, and 2011) and included into the study. Spatial cluster and autocorrelation analysis was done to explore the patterns of childhood diarrhea.\n\n\nResults\nChildhood diarrhea clustered spatially at a national level in all survey periods (Moran’s I: 0.3830–1.3296, p &lt; 0.05). Significant spatial clusters were found in different survey periods across the regions. The most likely spatial clusters were found in Southern Nations Nationalities and people, West Oromia, Gambella, Benshangul-Gumuz, and Somali regions. Childhood diarrhea also clustered at the border areas of Southern Nations Nationalities and People and Tigray, Central Somali and Western Oromia, Gambella and Amhara (West Gojam, Awi, Oromia, and Wag Himra) regions. In 2000, the most likely clusters were found in Southern Nations Nationalities and People, West Oromia, and Gambella regions (LLR = 55.37, p &lt; 0.001); in 2005, at Southern Nations Nationalities and People (LLR: 45.69, p &lt; 0.001); and in 2011, at Gambella, West Southern Nations Nationalities and People and Oromia, and Benshangul-Gumuz regions (LLR: 51.09, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this study, childhood diarrhea remains public health problem and had a spatial variation across the regions. Identifying the risk areas would help in designing effective interventions to reduce childhood diarrhea in these areas."

The work carried out included analysis of the spatial distribution of confirmed DF cases from January 2007 to December 2018 characterising the sociodemographical and ecological factors in DF high-risk areas. Spearman’s rank correlation was used to examine the relationship between DF incidence and climatic factors. Spatial clustering and hotspots of DF were examined using global Moran’s I statistic and the local indicator for spatial association analysis. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was performed to compare and identify demographical and socio-ecological characteristics of the identified hotspots and low-risk clusters. The seasonality of DF incidence was correlated with precipitation (r= 0.254, P&lt; 0.01), humidity (r= 0.340, P&lt; 0.01), dipole mode index (r=–0.459, P&lt; 0.01) and Tmin (r=–0.181, P&lt; 0.05). DF incidence was spatially clustered at the village level (I= 0.294, P&lt; 0.001) and 22 hotspots were identified with a concentration in the central and eastern parts of Jakarta. CART analysis showed that age and occupation were the most important factors explaining DF clustering. Areaspecific and population-targeted interventions are needed to improve the situation among those living in the identified DF high-risk areas in Jakarta."

    "text": "Abstract\nObjective This study aimed to assess the incidence and risk factors of treatment failure among HIV/AIDS-infected children who were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Amhara National Regional State, Ethiopia.\nMethods A retrospective follow-up study was conducted from January 2010 to March 2016. A total of 824 children under the age of 15 who had started ART were included in the study. Data were collected from children’s medical charts and ART registration logbook using a standard checklist. A Weibull regression model was used to identify the risk factors of treatment failure. Adjusted HRs (AHRs) with 95% CIs were used to declare statistical significance.\nResults The mean (±SD) age of the children was 6.4±3.6 years, with a median (IQR) follow-up of 30.5 (14.6–51.4) months. Sixty-three children (7.7%, 95% CI 5.8 to 9.5) developed treatment failure, 17 (27.0%) of whom were immunological and 46 (73.0%) were clinical failures. The incidence rate of treatment failure was 22.1/10 000 person-months. The cumulative probability of failure was 0.4, with 28 562.5 person-month observations. Lack of disclosure (AHR=4. 4, 95% CI 1.8 to 11.3), opportunistic infections during initiation of ART (AHR=2.3, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.1) and prolonged follow-up (AHR=0.06, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.18) were the main predictors of treatment failure.\nConclusion This study revealed that the incidence of treatment failure remains a significant public health concern in Ethiopia. Undisclosed HIV status to children, the presence of opportunistic infections during initiation of ART and prolonged follow-up were found to be the main predictors of treatment failure. Hence, early detection of treatment failure and further studies on viral monitoring need to be considered."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nVaccination is an effective public health intervention for reducing childhood morbidity and mortality. It becomes more effective if the child receives the full course of the recommended doses. In Ethiopia, many children fail to complete the full course, and there is a consensus on the low coverage of complete vaccination; however, factors relating to the problem have not been largely explored by community based studies. The problem still persists posing a challenge to the health care delivery system. Therefore, this study assessed the predictors of incomplete childhood vaccination among children aged 12–23 months. The result is expected to improve health promotion efforts to boost childhood vaccination uptake and serve as a tool for increasing the utilization of the existing Expanded Program on Immunization efforts.\n\n\nMethods\nA community-based unmatched case-control study was conducted in six kebeles of Amanuel district in east-central Ethiopia from March to April 2014. Census was carried out to identify cases and controls. A total of 308 mother-child pairs (154 cases and 154 controls) were selected by the stratified multistage sampling technique. Cases were children in the 12–23 months age group who missed at least one dose of the recommended vaccination. Child vaccination cards and mothers’ oral responses were used to verify the vaccination status of each child. Data were collected using interviews through a pretested structured questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version 20. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered for declaring statistical significance.\n\n\nResults\nThe study revealed that the odds of defaulters from childhood vaccinations noted among mothers who delivered at home were high [AOR = 4.11, (95% CI: 2.26, 7.47)]. Other irregularities detected were lack of antenatal care visits during pregnancy [AOR = 2.54, (95% CI: 1.31, 4.95)], misperception about vaccines [AOR: 2.83, 95% CI: (1.56, 5.15)], and lack of postnatal care visits [AOR = 2.51, 95% CI: (1.18, 5.33)].\n\n\nConclusion\nHome deliveries, a misconception on vaccine, lack of prenatal and postnatal care services were found to be the predictors of incomplete childhood vaccinations. Therefore, increasing mothers’ awareness on childhood vaccination, strengthening maternal health service utilization, and supervision and monitoring are highly recommended to reduce incomplete vaccination in the study setting."

Modified Poisson regression analysis was conducted to assess the association (risk ratios) of socio-emotional trajectory group membership with pre-care maltreatment, placement, and caregiver-related factors.\n\n\nResults\nThree trajectories of socio-emotional development were identified: 'persistently low difficulties' (average CBCL T-score changed from 40 to 38 over time), normal (average CBCL T-score changed from 52 to 55 over time), and clinical (average CBCL T-score remained at 68 over time) trajectories. Each trajectory presented a stable trend over time. Relative/kinship care, as compared with foster care, was associated with the \"persistently low\" socio-emotional trajectory. Being male, exposure to ≥8 pre-care substantiated risk of significant harm (ROSH) reports, placement changes, and caregiver’s psychological distress (more than two-fold increased risk) were associated with the clinical socio-emotional trajectory.\n\n\nConclusions\nEarly intervention to ensure children have a nurturing care environment and psychological support to caregivers are vital for positive socio-emotional development over time among children in long-term OOHC."

    "text": "Abstract\nMulti-site research studies are essential if we are to conduct national research across all Australian jurisdictions. There is widespread agreement among clinicians and researchers that obtaining essential approvals to conduct multi-site research studies in Australia can be complex, bureaucratic and time consuming. Although there is inherent value in the review process, resources and months of valuable research time are often expended long before the study has begun. Using our recent experience for a multi-site, longitudinal paediatric cohort study of children and adolescents who were detained in offshore immigration detention on Nauru, we describe the process of navigating the ethics and governance approval systems. We identify tips for researchers and clinicians conducting multi-site studies, including early consultation with ethics and governance committees, using their recommended templates, anticipating time delays, and commencing time consuming processes as early as permissible. Our recommendations at the systemic level include streamlined and integrated ethics and governance review processes for all Australian jurisdictions, with co-ordinated requests for further information, a standardised approach across all Research Governance Offices, a rapid system for addressing amendments and individualised study support and consultations. Above all, a nationally agreed framework whereby ethics and governance committees across jurisdictions communicate with each other, use the same electronic platform and present a unified process whilst protecting the welfare, rights, dignity and safety of research participants is required. The complexity of the current ethics and governance processes may inadvertently and unintentionally be a barrier to conducting ethical research."

However, the prevalence of overweight and obesity among Ethiopian adults who live in the major cities is not well documented. Therefore, the study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with overweight and obesity among adults in Dessie town, northeast Ethiopia.\n\n\nSubjects and methods\nA community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 15 to April 10, 2015. A total of 751 adults aged 18–64 years were included. Multistage followed by systematic random sampling method was used to select the study participants. Both bivariable and multivariable ordinal logistic regression were done. The proportional odds ratio (POR) with a 95% CI was reported to show the strength of association. A P-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n\nResults\nOf all participants, 19.9% (95% CI: 16.9%, 23.1%) were recorded to be overweight and 8.6% (95% CI: 6.6%, 10.9%) to be obese. The odds of being overnourished (overweight or obese) were higher among adults who had snack intake habit (POR =1.52; 95 CI: 1.04, 2.20), drank alcohol (POR =1.75; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.97), had higher wealth status (POR =2.29; 95% CI: 1.26, 4.19), and were married (POR =2.22; 95% CI: 1.49, 3.29) compared to their counterparts.\n\n\nConclusion\nCompared to the previous local reports, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the study area is high; this appears to be an emerging problem in Ethiopia. Hence, there is a need to develop a control and prevention strategy on potentially modifiable risk factors of overweight and obesity."

The present study determined the level of awareness of occupational hazards and associated factors among welding employees at Lideta Sub-City, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n\n\nMethods\nA work site-based cross-sectional study was conducted among welding employees Lideta Sub-City, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from April to May 2015. Stratified sampling followed by simple random sampling techniques was used to select the study participants. A pilot tested and structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Multivariable analyses were employed to see the effect of explanatory variables on workers’ awareness of occupational hazards.\n\n\nResults\nAccording to our criteria of awareness 86.5 % of surveyed workers were aware of occupational hazards. A higher work experience, presence of work regulation, job satisfaction, being married, being single, and a higher educational status were factors significantly associated with workers’ awareness of occupational hazards.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis study revealed that the level of awareness of occupational hazards among welders was high. However, this does not mean that there will be no need for further strengthening of the safety measures as significant proportions of the workers still had low awareness. Interventions to boost workers awareness of occupational hazards should focus on areas, such as provision of safety trainings, promotion of safety advocacy, and enforcement of appropriate workplace safety regulation."

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed health systems in both developed and developing nations alike. Africa has one of the weakest health systems globally, but there is limited evidence on how the region is prepared for, impacted by and responded to the pandemic.\nMethods We conducted a scoping review of PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL to search peer-reviewed articles and Google, Google Scholar and preprint sites for grey literature. The scoping review captured studies on either preparedness or impacts or responses associated with COVID-19 or covering one or more of the three topics and guided by Arksey and O’Malley’s methodological framework. The extracted information was documented following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension checklist for scoping reviews. Finally, the resulting data were thematically analysed.\nResults Twenty-two eligible studies, of which 6 reported on health system preparedness, 19 described the impacts of COVID-19 on access to general and essential health services and 7 focused on responses taken by the healthcare systems were included. The main setbacks in health system preparation included lack of available health services needed for the pandemic, inadequate resources and equipment, and limited testing ability and surge capacity for COVID-19. Reduced flow of patients and missing scheduled appointments were among the most common impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Health system responses identified in this review included the availability of telephone consultations, re-purposing of available services and establishment of isolation centres, and provisions of COVID-19 guidelines in some settings.\nConclusions The health systems in Africa were inadequately prepared for the pandemic, and its impact was substantial. Responses were slow and did not match the magnitude of the problem. Interventions that will improve and strengthen health system resilience and financing through local, national and global engagement should be prioritised."

    "text": "Abstract\nHabitual khat use has negative psychological, social, sexual, and economic consequences. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the prevalence of khat use and associated factors among university students in the University of Gondar. Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February to September 2011. Multistage sampling techniques were used to select the study participants. Anonymous self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. Epi Info and SPSS softwares were used to enter and analyze the data. Binary logistic regression was used to identify the determinant factors. Independent two-sample “t” test was employed to compare academic performance between khat chewers and non-chewers. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was used to assess the strength of the association. P-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. The current prevalence of khat chewing was 16.4%. Sex, place of upbringing, alcohol use, cigarette smoking, and history of family and friends related chewing khat were statistically associated with khat chewing habit. The prevalence of khat chewing was found moderate and had not any influence on academic performance. Targeted and consistent counseling by a close controller and guidance is recommended as a direct in-campus intervention to tackle this habit."

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: Ethiopia has been implementing a community health extension program (HEP) since 2003. We aimed to assess the successes and challenges of the HEP over time, and develop a framework that may assist the implementation of the program toward universal primary healthcare services.\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review and synthesis of the literature on the HEP in Ethiopia between 2003 and 2018. Literature search was accomplished in PubMed, Embase and Google scholar databases. Literature search strategies were developed using medical subject headings (MeSH) and text words related to the aim of the review. We used a three-stage screening process to select the publications. Data extraction was conducted by three reviewers using pre-prepared data extraction form. We conducted an interpretive (not aggregative) synthesis of studies.\nFindings: The HEP enabled Ethiopia to achieve significant improvements in maternal and child health, communicable diseases, hygiene and sanitation, knowledge and health care seeking. The HEP has been a learning organization that adapts itself to community demands. The program is also dynamic enough to shift tasks between health centers and community. The community has been a key player in the successful implementation of the HEP. In spite of these successes, the program is currently facing challenges that remain to be addressed. These challenges are related to productivity and efficiency of health extension workers (HEWs); working and living conditions of HEWs; capacity of health posts; and, social determinants of health. These require a systemic approach that involves the wider health system, community, and sectors responsible for social determinants of health. We developed a framework that may assist in the implementation of the HEP.\nConclusion: The HEP has enabled Ethiopia to achieve significant improvements. However, several challenges remain to be addressed. The framework can be utilized to improve community health programs toward universal coverage for primary healthcare services."
