## Abstract

One-third to one-quarter of the world's population is estimated to have latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) . These infected persons are at risk for developing active disease with a lifetime risk of reactivation estimated to be 5--10% . Prevention of reactivation of LTBI in population groups with higher risk of progression to active disease than the general population, is critical to end the global TB epidemic .
