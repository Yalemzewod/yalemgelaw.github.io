### Welcome !

<p class="topbr">

My name is Yalemzewod Assefa Gelaw. I'm currently a senior data scientist at the WA Department of Health, Perth. I hold a PhD in Epidemiology and Biostatistics from The University of Queensland in 2020, where I focused on mathematical modelling, data visualization, statistics, spatial modelling, and scientific writing. My educational background has prepared me to understand and address the unique data challenges within the healthcare sector.

Since 2016, I have worked as a data analyst/scientist and gained extensive experience in managing complex datasets, developing data pipelines, performing data integration, and predictive modelling. I am proficient in using tools such as R, SQL, Python, and Power BI, enabling me to handle the technical aspects of public health and medical data.
