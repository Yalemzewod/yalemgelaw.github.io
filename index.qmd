### Hello !

<p class="topbr">

Allow me to provide a brief overview of my skill set and experience. With over seven years of experience in data analytics, data management, statistical modeling, and research, I have developed a strong foundation in academia and the healthcare industry. My expertise lies in advanced statistical modeling techniques, including linear and logistic regression, machine learning, geostatistical modeling, and Bayesian statistics, to name a few. I proficiently use R and Python for data management, analysis, and statistical modeling, and I have a solid background in utilizing Excel and Power BI for visualization. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have successfully managed large datasets, conducted thorough analyses, and generated impactful visualizations, resulting in the publication of over 30 peer-reviewed journal articles. I hold master's and PhD degrees, specializing in Epidemiology and Biostatistics, which have provided me with a deep understanding of the intricacies of data analysis and modeling in the context of health-related research. I am passionate about leveraging my skills and expertise to contribute to meaningful projects within the data analytics and statistical modeling domain. I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality work, collaborating effectively with teams, and utilizing cutting-edge statistical techniques to derive actionable insights.
