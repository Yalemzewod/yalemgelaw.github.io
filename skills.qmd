I possess solid skills in `Epidemiology and Biostatistics`, and I have applied a range of advanced statistical and data analysis methods in my research. These methods include Classification and Regression Tree analysis, spatiotemporal analysis, Bayesian conditional autoregressive (CAR) models, survival analysis, longitudinal regression, and infectious disease modeling. My proficiency in data science and analysis is evident through the publication of my research articles

I have over five years of experience using `R` programming language, specifically for data management, data cleaning, statistical analysis, and advanced modeling. For example, I have worked on projects involving cleaning and analyzing longitudinal large datasets (e.g., [POCOLS](https://www.facs.nsw.gov.au/resources/research/pathways-of-care)) to derive insights and build machine learning model. I have used various packages such as ggplot2 for data visualization, dplyr for data manipulation, caret for building machine learning models, sf, sp, and INLA for spatial and spatio-temporal data management and modeling. Overall, my experience with R has equipped me with a strong foundation in data science.

I have a proficient skill in `Stata`, and I have been using it for data management, and statistical analysis s. I have worked on several projects involving longitudinal data analysis, where I have used Stata to perform group trajectory modeling and to estimate the socio-emotional trajectories of children in out-of-home care service. I am also comfortable using Stata for data manipulation and cleaning tasks, and have experience with advanced statistical techniques such as regression analysis and meta-analysis.
