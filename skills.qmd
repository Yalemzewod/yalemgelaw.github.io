I have over five years of experience using `R` programming language, specifically for data management, data cleaning, statistical analysis, and advanced modeling. For example, I have worked on projects involving cleaning and analyzing longitudinal large datasets (e.g., [POCOLS](https://www.facs.nsw.gov.au/resources/research/pathways-of-care)) to derive insights and build machine learning model. I have used various packages such as ggplot2 for data visualization, dplyr for data manipulation, caret for building machine learning models, sf, sp, and INLA for spatial and spatio-temporal data management and modeling. Overall, my experience with R has equipped me with a strong foundation in data science.

I have a proficient skill in `Stata`, and I have been using it for data management, and statistical analysis s. I have worked on several projects involving longitudinal data analysis, where I have used Stata to perform group trajectory modeling and to estimate the socio-emotional trajectories of children in out-of-home care service. I am also comfortable using Stata for data manipulation and cleaning tasks, and have experience with advanced statistical techniques such as regression analysis and meta-analysis.
